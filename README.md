# Homework: Reading Data

I downloaded (and have included in this repository) a database of 250 chocolate chip cookie recipes. You can find the original source data [here](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/cookies) and the article [here](https://pudding.cool/2018/05/cookies/).

| Header | Description | Data Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Ingredient` | The name of the ingredient. Some standardizing was done by hand, such as converting "flour" and "bleached flour" to "all purpose flour".|text|
| `Text` | The whole text description of the ingredient and the quantity (after scaling to 48 servings)| text |
| `Recipe_Index` | A tag used to label recipe sources. Tags beginning with "AR_" come form AllRecipes; tags beginning with "E_" come from Epicurious, and tags beginning with "Misc__" were hand-collected | text |
| `Rating` | If a rating was available on the recipe, it is provided as a numeric value. All ratings are normalized to be between 0 and 1.| number |
| `Quantity` | The scalar quantity of the ingredient, after scaling to 48 servings| number |
| `Unit` | The unit that the ingredient is measured in | number |

- **Other Notes:**
  - When scaling the ingredients to yield 48 servings, we interpreted one serving to be one cookie. This was the convention in the vast majority of recipes we collected. However, we cannot guarantee that every recipe followed this rule, and some recipes create cookies of different sizes. 

  -Units were converted as needed so that only one unit was used per ingredient.
